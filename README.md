Snowballs is a hotkeys-first, async, always-on, GPT client for macOS. 

This product requires you to have an [API key for OpenAI.](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Built for developers
Snowballs enables a quick workflow, where you can simply start a chat with `‚å• + Q`, write your query and return back to your code editor by pressing `‚å• + Q` again, without ever using your mouse.

# How is the API Key stored?
The API Key is stored directly into your Keychain.
It's only stored in memory and accessed when an API request towards OpenAI is made.
